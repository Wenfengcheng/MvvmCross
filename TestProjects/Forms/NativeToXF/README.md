NativeToXF
==========

NativeToXF is a TestProject within the MvvmCross framework that shows how to build an app that uses both Native views and Xamarin Forms Content Pages.

Among the features MvvmCross provides are:

- ViewModel to View bindings using own customizable binding engine, which allows you to create own binding definitions for own custom views
- ViewModel to ViewModel navigation, helps you share behavior on how and when to navigate
- Inversion of Control through Dependency Injection and Property Injection
- Plugin framework, which lets you plug-in cool stuff like GPS Location, Localization, Sensors, Binding Extensions and a huge selection of 3rd party community plug-ins

MvvmCross is extendable by you. We strive to let as much code be configurable and overridable, to let the developer decide how they want to use the framework. However, the framework is very usable without doing anything.
